## Language Performance Comparison of the same task (numerical solution of a differential equation) :
Only in the case of Python and Julia we are sure that the code is sufficiently well written to call it a fair comparison.
The Jupyter notebooks for the other languages have essentially been hacked together on one evening.
Therefore, there is probably a lot of room for improvements (especially in the case of C++).
Feel free to open an issue, if you know how to improve one of the implementations. But nevertheless, here is the current ranking: 


| Language          | Time (Âµs) |       
| ------------------| ----------| 
| Rust              |    0.373  |       
| Python with Numba |    4.430  |  
| Julia             |    6.474  | 
| C++               |    58.92  |  
| Perl              |    334.0  |  
| R                 |    478.0  |  
| Python            |   1600.0  |
