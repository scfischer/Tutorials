## Language Performance Comparison of the same Task (numerical solution of a differential equation) : 
Only in the case of Python and Julia we are sure that the code is suiifiently well written to call it a fair comparison. 
The Jupyter notebooks for the other languaes have essentially been hacked togehter on one evening. 
Therefore, there is probally a lot of room for improvements (especially in the case of C++). 
Feel free to open an issue, if you know how to improve one of the implementations. But nevertheless here is the current ranking: 


| Language          | Time (µs) |       
| ------------------| ----------| 
| Rust              | Time (µs) |
