## Language Performance Comparison of the same task (numerical solution of a differential equation) together with slides and notes from our seminar :
Only in the case of Python,Julia,R and C++ we are sure that the code is sufficiently well written to call it a fair comparison.
The Jupyter notebooks for the other languages have essentially been hacked together on one evening.
Therefore, there is probably a lot of room for improvements.
Feel free to open an issue, if you know how to improve one of the implementations.
