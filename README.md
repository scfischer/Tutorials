# Tutorials
Simple examples and tutorials (mainly Jupyter notebooks) for various topics regarding simulations in Bioinformatics or Biophysics. 
The used languages are mainly Julia and Python (apart from the language performance comparison). 
Install IJulia to use Julia in Jupyter notebooks. 
Feel free to download the files to play around and hopefully learn sth. from them ;).
